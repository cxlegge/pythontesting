# Python Projects
Code dump for python ideas.

1. Scriptmaker.py - A program which takes a captions.srt file (A YouTube captions file), and creates a script file without the timestamps and module numbers, and concatenates it into a block of text.

2. rock-paper-scissors.py - A script that runs a text game of rock, paper, scissors, with a bit of added daftness.

3. csvreader.py - Takes user input for a .csv file, counts the instances of x in the column along with empty cells.

4. csvdatalister.py - A souped-up version of csvreader, it returns a count of all data points in pre-specified columns and writes them to a .txt file.
